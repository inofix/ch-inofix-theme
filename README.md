# ch-inofix-theme
A bootstrap 3 based theme for Liferay 7.x

## How To Build
1. `cd $WORKSPACE/themes`
1. `git clone https://github.com/inofix/ch-inofix-theme.git`
1. `cd ch-inofix-theme`
1. `npm install`
1. `gulp build`

## Issues
Because of https://issues.liferay.com/browse/LPS-72409 the 'gulp watch' task does not work in 7.0.3. 

You will either have to stick to 7.0.2 for theme development or find a way to apply the fix to 7.0.3 GA4.
